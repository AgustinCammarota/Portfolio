In this project, I developed an **online store** that enables users to complete **the end-to-end purchase process** for notebooks and journals, from browsing the catalog to payment and order confirmation. The implementation leveraged Empretienda as the base platform, **utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to customize the user experience and optimize site functionality**.
