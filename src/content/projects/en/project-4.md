In this project, I developed a **home banking** platform for both mobile devices and the web, adapted to different geographies. I used a set of key technologies that include **Lit** for creating web components, **Angular** as the main framework for the web part, Cordova for mobile app integration, and **WebdriverIO** for test automation. The solution focused on providing a unified and efficient experience for users from different regions.
